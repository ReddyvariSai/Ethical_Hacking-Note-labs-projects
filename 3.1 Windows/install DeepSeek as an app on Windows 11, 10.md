#  install DeepSeek as an app on Windows 11, 10


You can install DeepSeek as an app on Windows 11 (and Windows 10), and in this guide, I’ll show you how to complete this task. DeepSeek is a new large language model (LLM) that has been making waves in the AI community, as it’s reportedly outperforming Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in various tasks while it’s still under development.

What sets DeepSeek apart is its efficiency, specialization, unrestricted access, and open-source foundation. DeepSeek is designed to be more efficient than other LLMs, meaning it can run on less powerful hardware and use less energy. This makes it more accessible to researchers and developers who may not have access to the latest and greatest hardware.

This new chatbot AI is designed to be good at specific tasks, such as code generation and question answering. This makes it more useful for certain applications than general-purpose LLMs like Gemini and ChatGPT.

Also, it’s open-source nature it’s freely available for anyone to use and modify. This promotes collaboration and innovation in the AI community.

Finally, it’s available for free without limitations on the number of queries you can perform each day. However, the chatbot can get busy, and you may have to wait to process a query. You can always check the service status on this page.

Although DeepSeek is easily accessible from your web browser and phone through the official mobile apps, it doesn’t have a native Windows app. However, you can install it as a Progressive Web App (PWA) through Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.

The Progressive Web App (PWA) technology enables websites to deliver a seamless app-like experience. It gives users offline functionality, notifications, automatic updates, effortless installation, and uninstallation. However, it is up to the developer to implement these functionalities.

In this guide, I will teach you the steps to install DeepSeek as an app on Windows 11 or Windows 10. It’s important to note that while Firefox supports PWAs, it doesn’t support installing web apps as standalone apps.
