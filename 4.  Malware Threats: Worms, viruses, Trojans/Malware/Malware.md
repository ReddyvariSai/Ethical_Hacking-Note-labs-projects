### **What is Malware?**
**Mal**icious **Soft**ware - Any software intentionally designed to cause damage, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt computer operations.

### **Common Types of Malware**

1.  **Virus:** Attaches itself to a clean file and spreads, corrupting files or systems. Requires user action to execute.
2.  **Worm:** Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without user interaction, often exploiting vulnerabilities.
3.  **Trojan Horse:** Disguises itself as legitimate software. It doesn't replicate but creates a backdoor for other threats or steals data.
4.  **Ransomware:** Encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom (usually in cryptocurrency) for the decryption key.
    *   **Double Extortion:** Steals data *before* encrypting, then threatens to leak it if the ransom isn't paid.
    *   **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS):** Criminals rent ransomware tools from developers.
5.  **Spyware:** Secretly monitors user activity (keystrokes, browsing, webcam) and sends data to a remote attacker.
    *   **Keylogger:** A specific type that records every keystroke.
6.  **Adware:** Displays unwanted, aggressive advertisements. Can be bundled with spyware.
7.  **Rootkit:** Grants administrator-level access ("root") and hides deep within an OS, making it extremely hard to detect.
8.  **Bot / Zombie:** Infects a device to make it part of a network of controlled machines (**botnet**), used for DDoS attacks or spam.
9.  **Fileless Malware:** Resides in memory (RAM) rather than files on disk, leaving fewer forensic traces.

### **Primary Delivery Methods (Infection Vectors)**

*   **Phishing & Spear Phishing:** Deceptive emails/texts tricking users into clicking malicious links or opening infected attachments.
*   **Malvertising:** Injecting malicious code into legitimate online advertising networks.
*   **Drive-by Downloads:** Automatic malware download when visiting a compromised website.
*   **Software Exploits:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers, or applications (e.g., unpatched software).
*   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating people into breaking security procedures (e.g., tech support scams).
*   **Removable Media:** Spreading via infected USB drives.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising a trusted software vendor to distribute malware to its customers (e.g., SolarWinds).

### **Modern Threat Landscape & Actors**

*   **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** Long-term, targeted attacks often by nation-states for espionage or sabotage.
*   **Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS):** A thriving underground economy where hacking tools, infrastructure, and services are rented out.
*   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Attacks using a vulnerability that is unknown to the software vendor (no patch exists).
*   **Polymorphic & Metamorphic Malware:** Can change its code to evade signature-based detection.
*   **IoT Malware:** Targets vulnerable Internet of Things devices (cameras, routers) to build botnets.

### **Key Defensive Strategies**

1.  **Layered Defense (Defense in Depth):** Don't rely on a single security product.
2.  **User Education & Awareness:** Train users to spot phishing and social engineering—the #1 attack vector.
3.  **Patch Management:** Regularly update OS, applications, and firmware to fix vulnerabilities.
4.  **Antivirus / EDR:**
    *   **AV:** Traditional signature-based detection.
    *   **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** Advanced tools that monitor for suspicious behavior and enable investigation/response.
5.  **Network Security:** Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), email/web gateways.
6.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Users and applications should have only the minimum access needed.
7.  **Strong Authentication & Access Control:** Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) everywhere possible.
8.  **Regular Backups:** Maintain **offline, immutable backups** as the primary defense against ransomware.
9.  **Zero Trust Model:** "Never trust, always verify." Assume breach and verify every request.

### **If You're Infected (Incident Response)**

1.  **Isolate:** Disconnect the infected device from the network (unplug Ethernet/Wi-Fi).
2.  **Contain:** Determine the scope. Prevent spread to other systems.
3.  **Identify & Eradicate:** Use security tools to find and remove the malware. Often requires a full system wipe and restore.
4.  **Recover:** Restore systems from clean backups.
5.  **Analyze & Learn:** Determine the root cause (the initial vector) to prevent recurrence.
6.  **Report:** For businesses, may have legal obligations to report breaches.

The field is constantly evolving. Staying informed about **current tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** used by threat actors is as important as implementing the core defenses.
