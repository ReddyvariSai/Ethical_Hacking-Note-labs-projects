### The Core Difference in One Sentence
*   A **Virus** requires you to run an infected *program*.
*   A **Worm** spreads automatically through *networks*.
*   A **Trojan** disguises itself as a *legitimate file* to trick you.

### 1. Virus (The Biological Contagion)
*   **Key Trait:** **Requires a host file and human action.** It attaches itself to a clean program or document (like an `.exe` or `.doc` file). It cannot activate until you run that infected program or open that file.
*   **Analogy:** Like a biological virus. It needs a living host cell (a program) to survive and replicate. It doesn't spread on its own; it spreads when the host moves (e.g., you send the infected file to someone).
*   **How it spreads:** Via shared files—USB drives, email attachments, downloads.
*   **Primary Goal:** To corrupt, modify, or delete your files and software. Its main purpose is to **damage and disrupt**.
*   **Example:** The **ILOVEYOU virus** (2000) spread as a love letter attachment. Once opened, it overwrote files and mailed itself to the victim's contacts.

### 2. Worm (The Self-Propagating Infestation)
*   **Key Trait:** **Spreads automatically and independently.** It does *not* need a host file or human action to replicate. It exploits vulnerabilities in operating systems or networks to travel.
*   **Analogy:** Like a parasitic worm that can move from one host to another on its own. Think of it as a self-replicating piece of software that crawls through network connections.
*   **How it spreads:** Through network shares, email (by sending itself), software vulnerabilities, or instant messages.
*   **Primary Goal:** To **spread as widely as possible**, consume bandwidth, and create backdoors. Its damage is often through **consumption of resources** and secondary payloads.
*   **Example:** The **Conficker worm** (2008) spread across millions of computers by exploiting a Windows flaw, creating a massive botnet.

### 3. Trojan Horse (The Deceptive Thief)
*   **Key Trait:** **Disguises itself as legitimate, useful software.** It tricks the user into installing it. Unlike viruses and worms, it does **not** self-replicate.
*   **Analogy:** Like the mythical Trojan Horse. It looks like a desirable gift (a free game, a crack, a utility), but once inside your walls (computer), hidden soldiers (malicious code) come out.
*   **How it spreads:** **Solely through user deception** (social engineering). You download and run it thinking it's safe.
*   **Primary Goal:** To create a **backdoor** for remote control, steal data (banking info, passwords), spy on you, or download other malware. Its purpose is **theft, espionage, and control**.
*   **Example:** **Emotet** started as a banking Trojan that stole credentials and later evolved to deliver other malware.

### Quick Comparison Table

| Feature | Virus | Worm | Trojan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spreads via** | Host files & human action | **Networks, automatically** | Deception & user installation |
| **Self-replicates?** | Yes, within hosts | **Yes, aggressively** | **No** |
| **Needs host file?** | **Yes** | **No** (standalone) | **No** (disguised as one) |
| **Primary Action** | Infects & corrupts files | Spawns copies & spreads | Creates backdoors & steals |
| **Main Danger** | Data destruction | Network overload, backdoors | **Data theft, remote access** |

### The Modern Reality: Hybrids & Blurred Lines
Today, most malware is a **blend** of these traits, making them more dangerous:
*   A **Trojan-Dropper** might install a **virus**.
*   A **Worm** might carry a **Trojan** payload.
*   **Ransomware** (like WannaCry) often uses **worm-like** techniques to spread across networks after a **Trojan-like** initial infection.

### How to Protect Yourself
1.  **Use Antivirus/Anti-Malware:** Essential, but not foolproof.
2.  **Keep Everything Updated:** Regularly update your OS and all software to patch security holes worms exploit.
3.  **Be Skeptical:** Never open unexpected email attachments or download software from untrusted sites (the primary Trojan vector).
4.  **Use a Firewall:** Helps block unauthorized network traffic, crucial against worms.
5.  **Backup Regularly:** The best defense against irreversible damage from viruses or ransomware.

In short: **Viruses** need you to run something, **Worms** spread on their own, and **Trojans** trick you into inviting them in.
