In this article, we’ll explore the roles of active and passive reconnaissance and examine how each approach helps identify security vulnerabilities.

We'll detail the distinct methodologies, tools, and optimal scenarios for their application, providing a deep dive into the essentials of these cyber security tactics.

## What is Reconnaissance?

Reconnaissance, mainly referred to as ”recon” or “exploration”, refers to gathering information about an adversary before engaging with it as your potential target. It is a crucial step in acquiring in-depth insights essential for preparing strategies, whether for enhancing network security or successfully competing in corporate initiatives. It helps you know your potential target's weaknesses, vulnerabilities, capabilities and intentions to launch a better and more sophisticated attack.

To understand reconnaissance, let's consider a situation about a thief who can be related to a malicious user who wants to barge into any particular building. Will they go directly into the building? Will they first gather all the necessary information about the building, such as all the entrances, security guard(s) details, potential security weaknesses and loopholes, or any backdoors?

Of course, they’ll need a foolproof plan for a successful robbery, so after gathering all the required information, they will plan further about how the system can be attacked.

As stated earlier, robbers can get the desired information in two ways: actively or passively. By implementing an active data-gathering technique, they can go directly on the spot and get the information, but they will expose themselves. While applying passive data-collecting methods, they can get the information by watching from a distance and asking for other resources without exposing themselves.

If the hacker wants to compromise a system or a host, they will first gather all the necessary information about the target. This process of gathering information directly engaging the target or indirectly through monitoring or getting information from a third party is termed reconnaissance. This is the first and foremost important step of ethical hacking and is referred to as the most critical step to perform a successful attack.

## Active Reconnaissance

Here, the attacker directly connects or interacts with the target and tries to get some information by engaging with it. They might opt for social engineering (making a call and asking for some information while pretending to be someone else or using other social engineering techniques). The attacker here exposes themself to the target; it is an intrusive approach.

A perfect and famous example of active reconnaissance is the “watering hole attack”. In this technique, as the name suggests, the attacker will infect the websites that the targets would like to use by profiling their interests, and when they visit those sites, the attacker will gain access to their systems through the loopholes they created. It’s just like an animal who wants to attack its prey, so instead of chasing them, they know the prey will come to the water hole to drink water. So, when they visit the watering hole, the animal will take over its prey. This attack is performed using social engineering, and it is not easily detectable and works wonders for the attackers.

## Passive Reconnaissance

As already discussed, passive reconnaissance involves collecting information about a target without directly interacting with its systems, making it a nonintrusive approach that minimises the risk of detection. In this technique, attackers gather data available through public sources or intercept traffic without alerting the target to their presence. For instance, an attacker might monitor social media posts or public databases to gather information about an organisation's employees, systems, or operational details without making direct contact or triggering security systems.
