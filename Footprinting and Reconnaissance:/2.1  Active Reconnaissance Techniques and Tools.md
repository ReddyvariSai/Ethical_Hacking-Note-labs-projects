# Active Reconnaissance Techniques and Tools

## Social Engineering

Social engineering focuses on manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information, and it's a critical aspect of active reconnaissance. The Social Engineer Toolkit (SET) is primarily used to assist in conducting attacks that involve social engineering methods such as phishing and pretexting. This toolkit provides a comprehensive range of functionalities that enable the simulation of various tactics to exploit human vulnerabilities effectively.

## Port Scanning

Port scanning is crucial for identifying open ports and the services that run on websites or webapps, revealing potential vulnerabilities and entry points for attacks. Nmap, a versatile tool for network discovery and security auditing, is extensively used for this purpose. It provides detailed insights into the target’s network environment, helping cyber security professionals understand potential risks.


## Network Mapping

Network mapping involves creating a detailed map of an organisation's network infrastructure, revealing the network's topology, connected devices, and communication protocols. Zenmap, the GUI version of Nmap, simplifies this process with its user-friendly interface and advanced mapping features. It allows for comprehensive network data visualisation, which is vital for thorough security assessments.

## DNS Enumeration

DNS enumeration is locating all DNS servers and their associated records for a domain, which can reveal critical information about a network's structure and security posture. DNSrecon is utilised for this technique, offering a comprehensive set of functionalities for gathering DNS-related information. This tool helps map out the network's DNS landscape, which is essential for understanding the scope of potential cyber security threats.

## OS Fingerprinting

OS fingerprinting is essential for identifying the operating system running on a target device, which provides crucial information for crafting targeted attacks. By sending network packets and analysing the responses using tools like Xprobe2 or p0f, attackers can determine the operating system with high accuracy. This information is vital for understanding the target system's security framework and potential vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is a proactive security technique used to identify and address vulnerabilities in a system before an attacker can exploit them. Tools like Nessus or OpenVAS are commonly used to scan target systems for known vulnerabilities, providing detailed reports on potential security weaknesses. These scans allow for the early detection and remediation of flaws that could otherwise be exploited in an attack.
