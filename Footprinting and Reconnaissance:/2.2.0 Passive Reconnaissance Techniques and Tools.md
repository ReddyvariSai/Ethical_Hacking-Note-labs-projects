# Passive Reconnaissance Techniques and Tools


## Packet Sniffing
Packet sniffing captures data packets traversing through a network, providing insights into traffic and internal communications without actively engaging the target system. Wireshark, a prominent network protocol analyser, allows users to interactively capture and browse the traffic on a computer network. It is extensively utilised for network troubleshooting and software and protocol development, making it a crucial tool for passive reconnaissance.


## Search Engine Dorking

Search engine Dorking utilises advanced search operators to uncover specific information hidden within search results, often revealing sensitive data or security gaps. The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) is a valuable resource aggregating these operators, aiding attackers in finding publicly exposed information critical for further exploitation.

## Public Data Aggregation

Public data aggregation involves collecting information from publicly accessible databases such as WHOIS, web registries, and financial records, which can reveal much about an organisation’s digital presence. Robtex is a tool that performs deep dives into domains, DNS, and IP data, providing comprehensive insights essential for passive analysis and planning.

## Social Media Analysis

Social media analysis entails scrutinising platforms to gather personal and organisational data. Maltego offers robust capabilities for mining open sources and analysing connections in a visual graph format. This tool is handy for uncovering relationships and patterns that could be exploited in targeted attacks.

## Archival Research

Archival research explores historical web content to uncover information that has been removed or changed on current websites. The Wayback Machine allows users to view archived versions of web pages, providing access to a wealth of historical data that can reveal previous vulnerabilities or sensitive information inadvertently exposed in the past.

## Email Harvesting

Email harvesting collects email addresses from a target organisation, often for use in spear phishing or other social engineering attacks. theHarvester is a tool specifically designed for scraping email addresses and other related information from various public sources. This tool is invaluable for attackers aiming to build detailed social engineering campaigns by leveraging publicly available data.
